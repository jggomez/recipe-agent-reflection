## Agent LLM with Reflection for Recipe Generation (AR²G)

This repository contains the code for AR²G (**A**gent **L**LM with **R**eflection for **R**ecipe **G**eneration). This system utilizes a large language model (LLM) and reflection to create innovative and improved recipes based on user-provided ingredients and a chosen country.

This Repository is based on [Translation Agent: Agentic translation using reflection workflow repository](https://github.com/andrewyng/translation-agent) and this article [Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11366)

### Functionality

AR²G operates through a three-step process:

**1. Initial Recipe Generation:**

  * The user specifies a list of ingredients and a desired country for the recipe.
  * AR²G utilizes an LLM to generate a set of initial recipes based on the provided information.
  * The LLM draws its knowledge from a vast dataset of recipes and culinary information. 

**2. Reflection:**

  * AR²G analyzes the initial recipes generated by the LLM.
  * Utilizing reflection techniques, the system assesses factors such as:
      * Feasibility of the recipe (availability of ingredients, cooking techniques)
      * Local ingredients (Research what ingredients are commonly found in the country.
      * Cooking techniques (Are there specific ways dishes are prepared in this country?)
      * presentation (How is food typically presented in this country) 
  * Based on this analysis, AR²G generates constructive criticism and suggests improvements for each recipe.

**3. Recipe Improvement:**

  *  AR²G leverages the feedback from the reflection stage to refine the initial recipes.
  * The system may:
      * Suggest substitutions for unavailable ingredients
      * Recommend adjustments to cooking methods or ingredient quantities
      * Introduce additional elements to enhance flavor profiles
      * Ensure alignment with the chosen country's culinary style

**Overall, AR²G delivers unique and improved recipes that cater to user preferences while maintaining culinary integrity.**

### Installation

```shell
pip install poetry 
poetry install
poetry shell # activates virtual environment
```

### Usage

1.  **Prepare your ingredients:** List your available ingredients.
2.  **Choose a country:** Specify the country whose cuisine you'd like the recipe to be inspired by.
3.  **Run the program:** Execute the AR²G code with your chosen ingredients and country.
```
poetry run python recipes_agent_reflection.py
```
5.  **Explore the results:** AR²G will provide improved recipes based on your input.


###  Benefits

* **Innovation:** AR²G's reflection process allows for exploration of creative recipe ideas beyond standard combinations.
* **Improved Recipes:**  The system refines the initial LLM output to ensure feasibility and enhance flavor profiles.
* **Customization:** AR²G caters to user preferences by leveraging provided ingredients and desired country for inspiration.
